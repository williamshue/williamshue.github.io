Golub van Loan outlines on page 111: 

That if you have two equations

$$\begin{align*}
3x_1 + 5x_2 &= 9 \\
6x_1 + 7x_2 &= 4
\end{align*}$$

You don't even need the concept of Gaussian elimination to subtract 2 times the top equation from the bottom equation

$$\begin{align*}
3x_1 + 5x_2 &= 9 \\
6x_1 + 7x_2 &= 4)
